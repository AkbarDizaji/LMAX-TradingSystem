# LMAX Trading System

This project provides a multi-language implementation of the LMAX Disruptor architecture for building high-performance trading platforms. The LMAX architecture is a low-latency, high-throughput system designed for handling millions of trades per second. It is an in-memory, event-sourced system using a pattern known as Disruptor to achieve high concurrency without the need for traditional locks.
## Implemented Languages
**PHP (Laravel): **Full implementation of LMAX architecture.
**C# (.NET): **Full implementation of LMAX architecture.
## Overview of LMAX Architecture
LMAX is a highly efficient architecture, designed to process a high volume of transactions in financial trading systems. The core components include:

- **In-memory Business Logic Processor:** Handles all business logic in a single-threaded manner for simplicity and speed.
- **Disruptor Pattern: **A high-performance concurrency framework that replaces traditional queues with a lock-free ring buffer.
- **Event Sourcing:** All changes are captured as a series of events, making the system resilient to failures by replaying events from a durable store.
## Features
- **In-memory processing:** All transactions are processed in memory, reducing I/O overhead and increasing speed.
- **Event Sourcing:** Ensures system state can always be rebuilt by replaying events.
- **Concurrency:** Utilizes the Disruptor pattern to handle concurrent tasks without the need for locks.
- **Multi-language support:** Current implementations in:
	- PHP (Laravel)
	- C# (.NET)

## Project Structure
**/Laravel-PHP**: Contains the LMAX implementation using the Laravel framework in PHP.
**/.NET-C#**: Contains the LMAX implementation using .NET in C#.

Each language folder contains its own implementation, including the core architecture and a sample application demonstrating how LMAX can be used for handling high-frequency transactions.
